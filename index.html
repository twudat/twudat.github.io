The FREE-XXX-O-DUS project exists because the project it is based on contains obfiscated python code and requires pin 
numbers to continue functionality.
            
I feel this is not in the spirit of Kodi development.

The Current maintainer https://github.com/nemesis668 [@Nemzzy668] seems not to object to bypassing
licensing [*see below*] and therefor should not object to my deobfiscation and removal of the pin system code.
